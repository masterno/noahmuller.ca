### **The 50,000 Pound Hour: My First Step to a New Level of Strength**

50,000 pounds.

In one hour.

That's the weight of a commercial dump truck, five large elephants, or a small house. And last week, I deadlifted it.

This wasn't just a workout; it was an experiment. A test. After years of training clients and honing my own strength as a kinesiologist and personal trainer, I wanted to answer a question: What are the true limits of intelligent work capacity? This challenge was my first step toward finding out.

#### **The "Why": From Injury to a Smarter Challenge**

Every trainer has a secret: we're not invincible. Just a few weeks ago, I was nursing a mild upper back injury from benching—a frustrating but humbling reminder to always respect the weight. As I recovered, I felt the pull to do something big. Not just to lift heavy for a few reps, but to tackle a challenge that required strategy, endurance, and meticulous planning.

The goal wasn't just to prove my back was healed; it was to prove that a smarter approach could lead to staggering results. I needed hard data. So I designed a test: the 50,000 Pound Hour. It would be the perfect way to see if my theories on pacing, recovery, and biomechanics would hold up under extreme volume.

#### **The Blueprint: How to Deadlift 50,000 lbs in an Hour**

You can’t just walk into a gym and lift 50,000 pounds. You need a precise plan. Here was my exact blueprint:

- **The Target:** 50,000 lbs total volume
- **The Weight:** 210 lbs on the bar
- **The Reps:** 6 reps per set
- **The Pace:** 1 set every 90 seconds
- **The Total:** 40 sets in 60 minutes for a grand total of **50,400 lbs**

This plan was built on a foundation of strategy.

- **Why the Sumo Stance?** For an endurance event, protecting the lower back is everything. The sumo deadlift allows for a more upright torso, placing the majority of the load on the powerful glute and leg muscles, not the lumbar spine.
- **Why 210 Pounds?** It was the sweet spot—heavy enough that every rep was meaningful, but light enough that I could maintain perfect, crisp technique for the entire hour.
- **Why 90 Seconds Rest?** This was the secret weapon. A 60-second rest period would have created too much cardiovascular fatigue. 90 seconds gave me just enough time to let my heart rate settle, partially replenish energy systems like ATP, and mentally reset for the next perfect set.

#### **The Experience: Inside the Grind**

**Minutes 1-20 (The Rhythm):** The first 20 minutes were all about finding a rhythm. The clank of the plates, the feel of the chalk on my hands, the steady cadence of a set every 90 seconds. The weight felt light, confidence was high, and I settled in for the long haul.

**Minutes 21-40 (The Grind):** This is where the work began. I had to shift from "autopilot" to "manual control." Every set required focus. I concentrated on my breathing, on driving the floor away, and on locking out with my glutes. The music in my headphones got a little louder.

**Minutes 41-60 (The Championship Round):** With about 10 sets to go, the fatigue became real. It wasn't a sharp pain, but a deep, systemic tiredness. My legs felt heavy, and my brain was telling me to slow down. This is where the mental game took over. I broke it down: "Just one more perfect set." I repeated that mantra ten times until the final rep was locked out.

#### **The Aftermath: Two Critical Lessons Learned**

**1. The Soreness Tells the Real Story.**
The day after, I felt exactly what I’d hoped for: my legs and glutes were incredibly sore, but my back felt fantastic. This was the ultimate validation. It proved the strategy worked. The load went where it was supposed to go, and my form held up under pressure.

**2. I Left a Ton of Performance on the Table.**
Here's the most exciting part: I did this on a normal diet. No special carb-loading, no intra-workout fuel, not even electrolytes. The fatigue I felt in those final sets wasn't my true limit; it was simply my body running low on easily accessible fuel. This means I have a whole other level of performance to unlock.

#### **What’s Next: Doubling Down**

The 50k challenge was a massive success. It proved the plan is sound, the body is ready, and that an even bigger goal is within reach. It's time to take the next step.

That’s why I’m officially taking on the **100,000 Pound Challenge** in the next few weeks, doubling the volume and pushing myself for a full two hours.

I'll be documenting the whole process, so if you want to see how it goes, be sure to follow my journey.
